# Strapi application

To start the Strapi project:
```
npm install
npm run develop
```

Login details:

```
Username: admin@admin.com
Password: Pass1234
```

There is one content type in the project, accessible at `http://localhost:1337/articles`.

If you get an error about port 1337 being in use, you probably have Strapi running in another command line or terminal.
